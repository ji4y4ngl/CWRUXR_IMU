# CWRUXR_IMU (IMUXR)

  This project aims to make use of the Sparkfun 9-Degrees-of-Freedom Inertial Momentum Unit (IMU) ICM20948 by integrating its data into the CWRUXR python framework. The product seeks to provide sensor data visualization through Microsoft Hololens 2 by creating a CWRUXR script. I modified code using the Sparkfun's opensource library made for this particular sensor at https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_9DoF_IMU_ICM20948_Py to create an Arduino code that can read IMU data, perform sensor fusion, and output adjusted acceleration, angular velocity, strength of magnetic field, and a rotation quaternion into the Serial port. Then CWRUXR can make use of the data to create a visualization object. The project can operate in two ways: 1) using serial USB connection to a ESP32 microcontroller and 2) directly send microcontroller data over WiFi using HTTPS request in the Arduino code directly (assuming you are using a WiFi capable ESP32 microcontroller). The users of CWRUXR should be able to see a cubeobject representing the sensor in Hololens space and that its rotation in Hololens should follow the rotational movement of the sensor in real time. There are also text objects outputting the sensor outputs aforementioned.
